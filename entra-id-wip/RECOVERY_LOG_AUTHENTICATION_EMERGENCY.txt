EMERGENCY AUTHENTICATION RECOVERY LOG

Issue: Authentication system compromised after Himmelblau implementation

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
==================
- Claude Code was implementing Himmelblau (https://github.com/himmelblau-idm/himmelblau) 
- Himmelblau provides REAL Microsoft Entra ID authentication for Linux systems
- After implementation, system authentication broke:
  * Lock screen stopped accepting local password
  * Ctrl+Alt+F2 terminal login also failed
  * System now logs in automatically without password prompt
  * This indicates PAM/authentication configuration is severely broken

DANGEROUS MODIFICATIONS MADE:
============================
Based on the entra-id.sh module, these critical changes were likely made:

1. PAM CONFIGURATION CHANGES:
   - Modified /etc/pam.d/login 
   - Modified /etc/pam.d/gdm-password (if using GDM)
   - Modified /etc/pam.d/sddm (if using SDDM)
   - Added pam_himmelblau.so modules
   - Lines added to various PAM files

2. NSS CONFIGURATION CHANGES:
   - Modified /etc/nsswitch.conf
   - Changed passwd/group/shadow lookups to include "himmelblau"
   - Original: passwd: files systemd
   - Changed to: passwd: files himmelblau systemd

3. DISPLAY MANAGER CONFIGURATION:
   - Modified /etc/gdm/custom.conf or /etc/sddm.conf
   - Disabled autologin settings
   - May have broken normal authentication flow

4. SYSTEMD SERVICES:
   - Started/enabled himmelblaud daemon
   - May be interfering with normal authentication

FILES THAT WERE LIKELY MODIFIED:
===============================
- /etc/pam.d/login
- /etc/pam.d/gdm-password  
- /etc/pam.d/sddm
- /etc/pam.d/system-auth
- /etc/nsswitch.conf
- /etc/gdm/custom.conf
- /etc/sddm.conf
- /etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf (new file)

BACKUP FILES TO LOOK FOR:
========================
The script should have created backups with timestamps:
- /etc/pam.d/*.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- /etc/nsswitch.conf.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS  
- /etc/gdm/custom.conf.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
- /etc/sddm.conf.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS

EMERGENCY RECOVERY STEPS:
========================

STEP 1: BOOT INTO RECOVERY MODE
-------------------------------
1. Reboot system
2. At GRUB menu, press 'e' to edit boot entry
3. Add 'single' or 'init=/bin/bash' to kernel line
4. Press Ctrl+X to boot

STEP 2: RESTORE AUTHENTICATION (AS ROOT)
-----------------------------------------
# Mount filesystem as writable
mount -o remount,rw /

# Stop potentially interfering services
systemctl stop himmelblaud 2>/dev/null
systemctl stop gdm 2>/dev/null
systemctl stop sddm 2>/dev/null

# Find and restore backup files
find /etc -name "*.backup.*" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Restore critical files (replace TIMESTAMP with actual timestamp):
cp /etc/pam.d/login.backup.TIMESTAMP /etc/pam.d/login
cp /etc/pam.d/gdm-password.backup.TIMESTAMP /etc/pam.d/gdm-password  
cp /etc/pam.d/system-auth.backup.TIMESTAMP /etc/pam.d/system-auth
cp /etc/nsswitch.conf.backup.TIMESTAMP /etc/nsswitch.conf
cp /etc/gdm/custom.conf.backup.TIMESTAMP /etc/gdm/custom.conf

# Remove himmelblau configurations
rm -rf /etc/himmelblau/
systemctl disable himmelblaud 2>/dev/null

# Restart authentication services
systemctl restart gdm  # or sddm

STEP 3: ALTERNATIVE - RESET TO DEFAULTS
---------------------------------------
If no backups exist, restore default configurations:

# Default nsswitch.conf
cat > /etc/nsswitch.conf << 'EOF'
passwd: files systemd
group: files systemd  
shadow: files
gshadow: files
hosts: mymachines resolve [!UNAVAIL=return] files myhostname dns
networks: files
protocols: db files
services: db files
ethers: db files
rpc: db files
netgroup: nis
EOF

# Reset PAM login (basic working config)
cat > /etc/pam.d/login << 'EOF'
#%PAM-1.0
auth       required   pam_securetty.so
auth       requisite  pam_nologin.so
auth       required   pam_unix.so nullok
account    required   pam_unix.so
password   required   pam_unix.so nullok sha512 shadow
session    required   pam_unix.so
session    required   pam_env.so readenv=1
session    required   pam_env.so readenv=1 envfile=/etc/environment
session    optional   pam_systemd.so
EOF

STEP 4: VERIFY RECOVERY
----------------------
# Test local user authentication
passwd opik  # Reset your password if needed

# Reboot and test
reboot

PREVENTION FOR NEXT TIME:
========================
1. ALWAYS test authentication changes on a VM first
2. Create comprehensive backups before authentication changes
3. Test with a second terminal session open as root
4. Implement authentication changes incrementally, not all at once
5. Have a live USB/recovery disk ready

WHAT HIMMELBLAU DOES:
====================
Himmelblau is a legitimate project that provides:
- Real Microsoft Entra ID authentication for Linux
- Integration with Azure AD for enterprise environments  
- PAM and NSS modules for system-wide authentication
- But it's complex and can break existing authentication if not configured carefully

TO CONTINUE HIMMELBLAU IMPLEMENTATION SAFELY:
============================================
1. First fully restore normal authentication
2. Test the implementation on a VM or test system first
3. Make incremental changes with testing between each step
4. Keep multiple terminal sessions open during configuration
5. Have proper backups and recovery plan

EMERGENCY CONTACTS:
==================
If you cannot recover:
1. Boot from Arch Linux live USB
2. Mount your root filesystem  
3. Chroot into your system
4. Restore the backup files
5. Or worst case: recreate user accounts from live environment

CURRENT REPOSITORY STATE:
========================
Files modified in git:
- install.sh (modified)
- lib/config-manager.sh (modified) 
- lib/core.sh (modified)
- modules/azure-ad.sh (added)
- modules/entra-id.sh (added - contains the problematic code)
- config/azure-ad.conf (added)
- config/entra-id.conf (untracked)
- helpers/azure-ad-test.sh (added)
- helpers/entra-id-test.sh (untracked)

The entra-id.sh module contains the dangerous authentication modification code
that likely broke your system.

LESSON LEARNED:
===============
Never modify system authentication (PAM/NSS) without:
1. Multiple backup terminal sessions as root
2. Complete system backup
3. Testing on non-production system first  
4. Understanding exactly what each change does
5. Having verified recovery procedures

This log should help you recover and safely continue development.
