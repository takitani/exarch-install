# Microsoft Entra ID Integration - Work in Progress

## Status: On Hold

This directory contains all the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) integration work that was in development for Exarch Scripts. The implementation has been moved here and put on standby due to complexity in achieving a fully working integration.

## Contents

### Authentication and Login Scripts
- `apply-entra-login-fix.sh` - Attempts to fix login issues with Entra ID
- `configure-entra-client.sh` - Main configuration script for Entra ID client
- `fix-greetd-pam.sh` - PAM configuration fixes for greetd
- `fix-hello-pin.sh` - Windows Hello PIN emulation fixes
- `test-autologin-transition.sh` - Testing script for autologin transitions

### Himmelblau Integration Scripts
- `apply-himmelblau-config.sh` - Applies Himmelblau configuration for Entra ID
- `configure-entra-app.sh` - Configure Entra application settings
- `create-entra-app.sh` - Create new Entra application
- `diagnose-himmelblau-pin.sh` - Diagnostic tool for PIN authentication issues
- `entra-id-setup.sh` - Main setup script for Entra ID
- `finalize-himmelblau.sh` - Final Himmelblau configuration steps
- `fix-himmelblau-complete.sh` - Complete fix attempt for Himmelblau
- `fix-himmelblau-pin-final.sh` - Final PIN authentication fixes
- `install-compiled-himmelblau.sh` - Install compiled Himmelblau binaries
- `install-himmelblau-complete.sh` - Complete Himmelblau installation

### Testing and Diagnostic Scripts
- `test-entra-credentials.sh` - Test Entra ID credentials
- `test-entra-environment.sh` - Test Entra ID environment setup
- `entra-id-test.sh` - Main test helper script

### Modules and Configuration
- `entra-id.sh` - Main module with Entra ID functions (45k lines)
- `entra-id-safe.sh` - Safer version of Entra ID module (17k lines)
- `entra-id.conf` - Configuration settings for Entra ID

## Background

The Microsoft Entra ID integration was being developed to provide:
- Single Sign-On (SSO) with Microsoft accounts
- Integration with Microsoft 365 services
- Azure AD authentication for enterprise environments
- PIN-based authentication similar to Windows Hello

## Technical Stack

- **Himmelblau** - Open source Azure AD/Entra ID client for Linux
- **PAM** - Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux authentication
- **greetd** - Minimal and flexible login manager

## Challenges Encountered

1. **PIN Authentication** - Complex implementation of PIN-based auth similar to Windows Hello
2. **PAM Configuration** - Intricate PAM stack configuration required for proper integration
3. **Display Manager Compatibility** - Issues with greetd and other display managers
4. **Session Management** - Difficulties with proper session initialization and management
5. **Credential Caching** - Complex credential storage and refresh token management

## Future Work

When/if this integration is revisited, consider:
1. Waiting for Himmelblau project maturity
2. Alternative authentication methods (password-only initially)
3. Simplified PAM configuration approach
4. Testing with different display managers
5. Creating isolated test environment first

## Note

This work is preserved here for future reference. The complexity of achieving a production-ready integration led to the decision to put this on hold. The main `install.sh` script has been cleaned of all Entra ID references.
